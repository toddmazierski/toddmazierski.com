<p>
  I'm a software developer with 10 years' experience writing Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP. Recent career highlights include launching the <a href="https://www.hisawyer.com/marketplace" target="_blank">Sawyer Marketplace</a> for children's activities, implementing TypeScript analysis for Code Climate, and building Etsy's order management app.

<p>
  My background is in software testing and customer support. Besides solid technology, I'm acutely aware of how important empathy, collaboration, and communication are to the success of projects.
