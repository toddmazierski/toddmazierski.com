<p>
  I'm a software developer with 9 years' experience writing Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP. Recent career highlights include implementing TypeScript analysis for Code Climate and building Etsy's new order management app with React and Redux.
</p>

<p>
  My background is in software testing and customer support. Besides solid technology, I'm acutely aware of how important empathy, collaboration, and communication are to the success of projects.

  I'm currently working for <a href="https://positiondev.com/" target="_blank">Position Development</a>, a worker-run software shop.
